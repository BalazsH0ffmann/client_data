# About client_data

This application is made by PySpark, with the IDE of Pycharm.

The environment is Spark version 3.3.2

Initially every needed library was imported.

The first step was to build up this application with the getOrCreate command.

The next step was reading the pathways, considering the appname.

Displayd the schema to see if there are any changes.

The next stel was rename the id columns to avoid to overlapping names.

After I joined them together on the id columns.

Then I filtered them only to UK and NL as a countries.

I dropped the columns from the dataframes.

I wrote the 2 dataframes back to the file system.

I specifyed the pathway of the files for supporting the functions later.

I made 3 functions as was desired between the requirements.

I built up logging function to track the activities and display the reactions from the logging function.
